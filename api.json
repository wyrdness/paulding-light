      "full": "The Paulding Light is a light phenomenon visible from Power Line Road (also called Robbins Pond Road) near Paulding, Michigan in the Upper Peninsula. For decades, locals and tourists have observed a mysterious light appearing down an old forest road—changing colors between red, white, and green, seeming to move or sway. Local legends attributed the light to various supernatural sources: a railroad brakeman's ghost carrying a lantern, a miner's spirit searching with a light, or Native American spirits. The phenomenon became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors eager to witness the \\\"ghost light.\\\""
