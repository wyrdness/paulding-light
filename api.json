      "summary": "Light phenomenon near Paulding, Michigan. Explained in 2010 as car headlights from Highway 45 refracted through valley atmosphere.",
      "full": "The Paulding Light is a light phenomenon near Paulding, Michigan in the Upper Peninsula. Appearing as a bright light down an old forest road (Power Line Road, also called Robbins Pond Road) that changes colors (red, white, green), the light appears nightly and seems to move or sway in a consistent location. Local legends attributed it to a railroad brakeman's ghost lantern, miner's ghost, or Native American spirits, making it a popular tourist attraction. In 2010, students from Michigan Tech proved conclusively that the lights are car headlights from Highway 45 refracted through the atmosphere. By synchronizing light sources with approaching cars, they demonstrated perfect correlation. The topography creates a natural viewing corridor for the refracted lights. This explanation is now scientifically confirmed."
